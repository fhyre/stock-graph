To run this locally you'll need to get an API key from [Polygon](https://polygon.io/).

I opted for [Polygon](https://polygon.io/) due to the rate limiting I was experiencing with [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/).

Then, create a `.env.local` file and add the variable `POLYGON_API_KEY` set with the key you receive from [Polygon](https://polygon.io/).
